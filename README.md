OOTB Scouter

This was a simple tool created for my robotics team Out Of The Box Robotics to enter data related to the FIRST RES-Q challenge. All data would first be entered into the app, exported into a CSV, and finally imported FTC Scouter is a Material Design Android application focused in collecting match data and analyzing it. The data is serialized in JSON and then converted into a mySQL database where Tableau visualizes the data.
